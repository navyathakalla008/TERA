TERA is a smart tailoring platform that lets users design custom outfits, find local tailors, and use AI tools for virtual fitting and style suggestions. With chat, bidding, and real-time tracking, it connects users and tailors digitally, making fashion easy, personal, and efficient.
TERA (Tailoring Enabled by Real-time AI) is a web-based intelligent tailoring and fashion
 platform that merges traditional tailoring practices with modern AI-driven technology. The

 This platform was developed to resolve existing challenges faced by customers and tailors,
 including limited digital communication, lack of personalization, and inefficient order handling.
 Users can design and personalize their clothing using AI-powered tools, access a range of
 available tailors nearby, and get recommendations based on body type, previous orders, or
 design trends.
 TERA stands out from traditional e-commerce clothing platforms by giving users control over
 the outfit creation process, making it highly personalized. It is also a powerful platform for
 designers to showcase and sell unique styles, creating new opportunities in the digital fashion
 economy.
 With support for multiple user roles—Customer, Tailor, and Designer—the platform ensures a
 well-structured experience for each user category. Security and responsive design are built in to
 make the platform seamless and scalable. The system was built using a modern web stack
 including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, Python, and MySQL.
 The aim of this introduction is to demonstrate how the TERA project brings innovation,
 connectivity, and efficiency to tailoring by integrating the latest technologies in web
 development and AI. The system supports dynamic user interactions and is capable of scaling to
 support a wide variety of customer preferences and tailoring services.
